        <h2>What is healthy lifestyle?</h2>
        <p>A healthy lifestyle is the first line of prevention to avoid the accelerated appearance of signs of aging. Eating a healthy, 
            well-balanced diet along with taking antioxidant supplements, such as vitamins C and E, may help prevent skin damage that leads to 
            premature aging. These vitamins have antioxidant properties that neutralize damage by free radicals. Recent evidence suggests that 
            the Mediterranean diet may be helpful to prevent early aging. Foods with high glycemic index cause production of AGEs, which damage 
            collagen and lead to saggy skin. Alcohol consumption can dehydrate the skin and may, over time, cause skin damage. Reducing alcohol 
            consumption is also beneficial. Exercise can improve circulation, boost the immune system, and improve mitochondrial functionality. 
            Proper sleep helps to refresh the body and may give the skin a more youthful look.</p>

        <h2>Nutrition</h2>
        <p>A healthy lifestyle requires a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins like beans, nuts, and fish. 
            It is also important to limit added sugars, unhealthy fats, and salt by choosing fresh foods and drinking water instead of sugary 
            drinks. Focusing on nutrient-dense foods, moderate portion sizes, and a variety of foods from all food groups supports overall health 
            and well-being.</p>

        <h2>Exercise</h2>
        <p>Its never too late to start being physically active and to achieve the benefits of an active lifestyle. Older adults can benefit from 
            all three types of exercise: aerobic, muscle-strengthening, and balance. Many activities, from exercise programs to household tasks, 
            can count towards the 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity and two days of muscle-strengthening activities recommended 
            each week. Physical activity can be an opportunity to participate in activities you enjoy, spend time with friends and family, get 
            outdoors, improve fitness, and maintain a healthy weight. Additionally, being physically active as an older adult may improve your 
            health and health-related quality of life. Active older adults also tend to live longer!</p>

        <h2>Sleep</h2>
        <p>Why do we need to sleep? People often think that sleep is just “down time,” when a tired brain gets to rest, says Dr. Maiken Nedergaard, 
            who studies sleep at the University of Rochester. “But that’s wrong,” she says. While you sleep, your brain is working. For example, 
            sleep helps prepare your brain to learn, remember, and create. Nedergaard and her colleagues discovered that the brain has a drainage 
            system that removes toxins during sleep. “When we sleep, the brain totally changes function,” she explains. “It becomes almost like a 
            kidney, removing waste from the system.” Her team found in mice that the drainage system removes some of the proteins linked with 
            Alzheimer’s disease. These toxins were removed twice as fast from the brain during sleep. Everything from blood vessels to the immune 
            system uses sleep as a time for repair, says Dr. Kenneth Wright, Jr., a sleep researcher at the University of Colorado. “There are 
            certain repair processes that occur in the body mostly, or most effectively, during sleep,” he explains. “If you don’t get enough sleep, 
            those processes are going to be disturbed.”</p>
